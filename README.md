# Machine Learning Algorithm Implementations   
*Core implementations for CyberLabs Competition + Extended PyTorch Models*

---

##  Competition Submissions 
**Algorithms Built from Scratch** (using **only NumPy/Pandas** ):  
- **Linear Regression**  
- **Polynomial Regression**  
- **Logidtic Regression**  
- **K-means Clustering**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- **N-Layer Neural Network (KNN)**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

##  Extended Implementations (Post-Competition)  
Added **PyTorch-based models** for deeper exploration:  
1. **RNN & LSTM**:  
   - Task: Predict next token in synthetic sine wave sequences.  
   - Dataset: Synthetically Generated sine waves .  
2. **Trigram Model**:  
   - Task: Text generation using probability smoothing.  
   - Dataset: `nltk.corpus.brown` .
3. **Transfomer Model**
   - Implemented the transformer architecture as described in "Attention is All you Need" Paper
   - Built all components including multi-head attention, self-attention , positional-encdoing and feed forward layers;
   - Trained model on WMT dataset(German to English Translation) with tokenisation using gpt=2 tokenizer
   - Optimized training using LR scheduler and evalution based on bleu scores
